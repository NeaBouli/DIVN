## Configuration
Before starting the application, you need to replace the placeholder for the Infura Project ID:
- In the file `DIVN/application/src/index.js`, replace `'YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'` with your own Infura Project ID.
- To obtain an Infura Project ID, create a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io) and set up a new project.
